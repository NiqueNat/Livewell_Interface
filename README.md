Welcome to Livewell Interface.
Bringing all the lessons together.
The Livewell User Interface project allows a user register for a personal account, where they are able to create, and search recipes. The searched recipes are retrived via a foodbank API from api-ninjas. The user created recipes can be edited, updtaed, and deleted.

The database includes tables for storing users information, store created recipes, store api retreived recipes, user goals, weight tracking records, and user notes.
